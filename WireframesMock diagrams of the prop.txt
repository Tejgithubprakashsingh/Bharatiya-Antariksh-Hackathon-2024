Solution Overview
Data Collection and Preprocessing

Data Collection: Gather OHRC images of lunar or planetary surfaces.
Data Annotation: Manually annotate craters and boulders in a subset of images to create a labeled dataset.
Data Augmentation: Apply techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the dataset size and variability.
Model Selection

Object Detection Models: Use models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, or SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for detecting craters and boulders.
Segmentation Models: Consider models like U-Net or Mask R-CNN for precise segmentation of craters and boulders.
Training the Model

Feature Extraction: Extract features from images using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Training: Train the model using the annotated dataset, ensuring to split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Model Evaluation

Metrics: Use metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU (Intersection over Union) to evaluate the model's performance.
Validation: Validate the model on unseen data to check for overfitting and generalization.
Deployment

Integration: Integrate the trained model into a system for automatic detection in real-time or batch processing.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface to visualize the detected craters and boulders on OHRC images.
API: Provide an API for researchers to access the detection results programmatically.
Continuous Improvement

Feedback Loop: Incorporate user feedback to improve the model continuously.
Retraining: Periodically retrain the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
