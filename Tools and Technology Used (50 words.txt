Project Overview:
The goal is to create an AI/ML model capable of automatically detecting craters and boulders of all shapes and sizes from OHRC data.
The model should attach relevant information to the detected craters, preferably in the form of a shapefile containing the boundary of the craters/boulders.
Objectives:
Automatic Detection: Design a model that can identify craters and boulders in OHRC images regardless of their shape, size, and illumination conditions.
Quantification: The model should quantify the selenographic position and diameter of the detected craters/boulders.
Expected Outcomes:
A polygonal shapefile or shape-size information of craters/boulders with their locations on the given OHRC images.
Dataset:
OHRC datasets publicly available in PDS4 format on Chandrayaan Map Browse would be suitable for training and testing.
Tools/Technologies:
Programming Languages: Python, C, C++, or other relevant languages.
Techniques: Image processing techniques for crater detection, AI/ML models for crater/boulder detection.
Steps to Achieve Objectives:
Selenoreference: Use auxiliary information provided with the OHRC images to selenoreference them with appropriate projection information.
Data Preparation: Prepare training and testing data.
Model Training: Train the AI/ML model using the datasets.
Evaluation Metrics: Define accuracy metrics based on precision and relevance.
