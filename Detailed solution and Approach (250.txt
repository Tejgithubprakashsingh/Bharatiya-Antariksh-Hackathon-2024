Detailed solution and Approach (250-300 words)
Problem Statement: To accurately and efficiently identify craters and boulders on celestial bodies using OHRC images through AI/ML techniques.
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:
Gather a substantial dataset of OHRC images with ground truth annotations (manually labeled craters and boulders).
Preprocess images to enhance features: noise reduction, contrast adjustment, and normalization.
Create training, validation, and testing datasets.
Feature Extraction:
Employ deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract relevant features from images.
Consider using pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) as a foundation and fine-tune them for the specific task.
Explore other feature extraction techniques like Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) or Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for comparison.
Object Detection Model:
Utilize object detection algorithms such as Faster R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD to localize and classify craters and boulders within images.
Train the model on the prepared dataset, optimizing hyperparameters for accuracy and efficiency.
Experiment with anchor box sizes and aspect ratios to improve detection performance.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision (mAP).
Analyze false positives and negatives to identify areas for improvement.
Consider using techniques like transfer learning to enhance model generalization.
Post-processing:
Implement filters to remove false detections based on size, shape, and other criteria.
Incorporate domain knowledge to refine results (e.g., crater morphology, boulder distribution).
Consider using clustering or segmentation methods to group detected objects into larger formations.
Key Considerations:
Data Quality: High-quality annotated data is crucial for training an accurate model.
Computational Resources: Deep learning models can be computationally intensive, requiring powerful hardware or cloud-based solutions.
Model Complexity: Balance model complexity with computational efficiency and performance.
Evaluation Metrics: Choose appropriate metrics to assess model performance based on specific requirements.
Domain Expertise: Collaborate with domain experts to refine the model and interpretation of results.
By following these steps and addressing the key considerations, it is possible to develop a robust AI/ML system for automated crater and boulder detection from OHRC images.
