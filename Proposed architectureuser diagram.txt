Proposed Architecture for Crater and Boulder Detection
Overview
The proposed system consists of several interconnected modules:

Image Acquisition: Receives high-resolution images from the OHRC.
Preprocessing: Prepares images for analysis by applying noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and normalization.
Feature Extraction: Extracts relevant features from preprocessed images using techniques like SIFT or HOG.
Model Training: Trains deep learning models (CNN, Faster R-CNN, YOLO) on a labeled dataset to classify and localize craters and boulders.
Object Detection: Applies the trained model to input images to detect and classify objects as craters or boulders.
Post-processing: Refines detection results by removing false positives and merging overlapping detections.
Visualization and Output: Displays detected craters and boulders on the original image and provides relevant metadata.

User Interface
The user interface should provide the following functionalities:

Image Upload: Allow users to upload OHRC images for analysis.
Parameter Tuning: Enable users to adjust model parameters (e.g., confidence threshold, image size) for fine-tuning performance.
Visualization: Display original images with superimposed detections (craters and boulders highlighted).
Data Export: Allow users to export detected objects as a data file (e.g., CSV, GeoJSON) for further analysis.
Model Management: Provide options to manage and deploy different trained models.
Additional Considerations
Real-time Processing: For time-critical applications, consider optimizing the system for real-time performance.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy the system on a cloud platform for scalability and accessibility.
Integration with GIS: Integrate the system with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial analysis and visualization.
Model Explainability: Incorporate techniques to explain the model's decision-making process for transparency and trust.
