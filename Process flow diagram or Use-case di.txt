process flow diagram

Diagram Components:
Input: OHRC images
Preprocessing: Image cleaning, noise reduction, enhancement
Feature Extraction: Extraction of relevant image features (e.g., shape, texture, color)
Model Training: Training of machine learning models (e.g., CNN, SVM) on labeled image data
Object Detection: Identification and localization of craters and boulders in new images
Post-processing: Refinement of detected objects (e.g., merging overlapping detections, removing false positives)
Output: Detected craters and boulders with associated metadata (location, size, shape)
Additional Considerations:
Feedback Loop: Include a feedback loop for model retraining with new data.
Error Handling: Incorporate error handling mechanisms for unexpected image conditions.
Visualization: Add a block for visualization of detected objects on original images.
